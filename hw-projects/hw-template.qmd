::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## Learning Objectives

Our learning objectives for this homework are:

-   Learn to use a template to make HW documents for BDSR2
-   Have something we can copy and paste to get started
:::

Here is where we would have an introduction to the lab.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer imperdiet at neque vel auctor. Mauris in imperdiet tellus. Vestibulum tincidunt maximus pretium. Nullam molestie viverra purus, ut viverra mauris. Aliquam pulvinar nec ante eu elementum. Donec at faucibus urna. Cras semper egestas lectus, et vulputate sapien gravida pulvinar. Proin sit amet laoreet est. Sed auctor, mauris in ultricies tristique, justo ipsum pulvinar risus, non tincidunt sem massa id libero. Etiam eget volutpat nunc. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Aenean rhoncus urna efficitur nunc tincidunt tristique. Sed rhoncus erat nec suscipit lobortis. Duis efficitur pellentesque enim ac feugiat. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae.


## Exercise 1
::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise 1

Copy and paste this template and delete all the boilerplate below.
:::

## Exercise 2
::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise 2

Get to work and make an actual lab!
:::

::: callout-important
1. Note that this will render into the `../docs/hw-project/` folder, so as to appear on our github pages site (once that is set up in the future). Looks like this may cause issues with the built-in viewer in `Rstudio`, so may have some more tweaking to do.
2. Also note that certain YAML-level options are being controlled by `_metadata.yml`

# Additional formatting

## Callouts

Quarto includes "callouts," including: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`. I think it will be useful to use a few of these in formulaic ways. We can use these however by defining a custom title and suppressing the icons where relevant

### Exercises

Let's use the "note" callout for the lab exercises. We can provide our own more informative titles as needed with `##` level headings inside the note as desired. If we like, we can also emd another "hint" callout and collapse them with `collapse=true`.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise 1

Do something involving making a machine learning model, probably!

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Hint

This would be helpful though.

### Learning Objectives

Let's override the icon of the caution callout with `icon=false` for "learning objectives" to start the document.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## Learning Objectives

Our learning objectives for this module are:

-   Introduce foundational frameworks and processes of machine learning
-   Introduce "splitting" data into training and test splits
-   Demonstrate use of linear regression in `tidymodels`
:::

### Tips

::: callout-tip
And one for tips and tricks etc.
:::

::: column-margin

:::


### Important

::: callout-important
And this important one for things we really want to flag. Probably use this mostly for instructions regarding saving, formatting. and submitting assignments.
:::

::: column-margin
Sort of like tips, we can also use the `.column-margin` div to add more conceptual asides or footnotes.
:::


## Code and figure formatting

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: This is an example figure and caption with annotations.

library(tidyverse) # <1>
data(iris) # <2>

iris %>%  # <3>
  ggplot(aes(x=Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) + # <3>
  geom_point() # <3>
```

1. Load the `tidyverse` package.
2. Get the `iris` data ready.
3. Use the `ggplot()` function to make a plot.

## References and citations

You can use pandoc citation style to add citations. Let's use the convention: `[@author1.author2YEAR]` and `[@author.etalYEAR]` (note lowercase names). A bibliography is automatically created at the end of the document

I've started off the references with our main text [@gareth.etal2014].

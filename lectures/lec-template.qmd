## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r echo=TRUE}
1 + 1
```


## Column formatting

Machine learning can be applied to tackle many different kinds of problems, including:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Supervised learning**

- Prediction
- Classification

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


**Unsupervised learning**

- Clustering

## CSS

See `style.css` for custom formatting options.

## Other formatting

::: callout-tip
Callouts work the same as for non-presentation documents. I don't think margin notes can be used though.
:::

## Citations

You can use pandoc citation style to add citations. Let's use the convention: `[@author1.author2YEAR]` and `[@author.etalYEAR]` A bibliography is automatically created.

I've started off the references with our main text [@gareth.etal2014].

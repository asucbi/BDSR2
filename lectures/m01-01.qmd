## What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is an umbrella term for a wide family of methods for analyzing and making inferences from patterns in data.

Can think of **Machine Learning** as including:

- Algorithms for finding patterns in data
- A set of practices for how to:
  - Manage data
  - Process data into "features"
  - Use machine learning models for prediction
  - Interpret the results of models to build understanding

## Data types

:::: {.columns .v-center-container}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Machine learning can be applied to many different kinds of data, including:

- text
- audio
- images
- video
- tabular data (e.g. survey data)

# Course Preview

## Classify "toxic" online comments

Build a pipeline for automatic identification of toxic comments, by applying the naive Bayes and penalized logistic regression models to a dataset of comments from Wikipediaâ€™s talk page edits.

## Build a Lie Detector

Use EEG and gaze recordings to identify when participants are lying or telling the truth.

## Read handwriting with neural networks

Use neural networks to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```


## Citations

You can use pandoc citation style to add citations. Let's use the convention: `[@author1.author2YEAR]` and `[@author.etalYEAR]` A bibliography is automatically created.

I've started off the references with our main text [@gareth.etal2014].

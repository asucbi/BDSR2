## What is a model?

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
##
Models are a way to create a simplified or controllable version of some scientific topic of interest.
:::

## Physical models {.center}

Engineers construct physical models to test the properties of their designs and to predict how complex systems will operate.

## Model animals {.center}

Biologists use model animals to examine biological systems and to conduct experiments that cannot be ethically conducted on humans.

## MONIAC

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


The MONIAC was a model of macroeconomic factors that used hydraulics moving water between tanks with pumps and drains to represent the flow of money to different areas of the economy.

## Statistical Models 

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
##
Provide an abstract, mathematical description of the topic or process of scientific interest
:::


::: {.fragment}
In the context of data science we create models of the __data generating process__.

- __Data__ are the objects of interest
- Work to construct model of the process or processes that generated that data

:::

## Schema of statistical models

The general format is:

$$\text{data} = \text{model} + \text{noise}$$

::: {.fragment}
Or more generally:

$$\text{data} = f(\text{model, noise})$$

The data are a __function__ of the model and noise.
:::

## The purpose of statistical models

As (data) scientists, we use models for ...

- __Prediction__
	- Predict a value for a new hypothetical observation
	- Forecast the future
	- Classify into categories
- __Inference__
	- Describe relationships
		- e.g. between lead exposure and personality
	- Test interventions to determine causal relationships

## Machine Learning vs. Statistics

- In **Statistics** we tend to be mostly focused on **inference**
- In **Machine Learning** we tend to be mostly focused on **prediction**

::: {.fragment}
But both methods can be serve both purposes!
:::

## Machine learning model schema

We can think of machine learning models as following the same schema:

$$\text{data} = f(\text{model, noise})$$

But the notion of data being a **function** of the model is often stretched a bit further. That is, it often is less connected to how we think about how the world works and more of an abstraction for prediction.
